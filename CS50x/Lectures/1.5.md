# Command Line

We can interact with a computer via the CLI (Command Line Interface) by typing
certain commands.

| Command | Description                              |
| :-----: | :--------------------------------------- |
|  `ls`   | Lists the files in the current directory |
| `clear` | Clears the screen                        |
|  `cd`   | Changes the current directory            |
|  `pwd`  | Shows the current working directory      |
|   `.`   | Shows the current directory              |
|  `..`   | Goes up one directory                    |
