# Stuff. Gotta take em all.

Stuff, gotta take em all is an interactive story with 4 characters each giving
the player items as the story progresses. It is all for just one purpose, the
ending slide. The player only needs to input 'Yes' or 'No' to play the entire
game as it's a choice based game. ;)
